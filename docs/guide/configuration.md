## Voice

Leon has multiple providers for his STT and TTS. You can configure one (or several) and choose your favorite.

:::tip Tip
To enable the Leon's STT and/or Leon's TTS, in your `.env` file, **you need to set `LEON_STT=true` and/or `LEON_TTS=true`**.

Also, **you need to inquire the provider by setting `LEON_STT_PROVIDER={YOUR STT CHOSEN PROVIDER}` and/or `LEON_TTS_PROVIDER={YOUR TTS CHOSEN PROVIDER}`**.
Please see the [environment variables section](/configuration#environment-variables) to know the providers values.

## Synchronizer

If a module has this option, once the module has been processed, you can synchronize your content via different methods.

> E.g. the *YouTube* module of the *[Video Downloader Package](https://github.com/leon-ai/leon/tree/master/packages/videodownloader)* allows you to synchronize your downloaded videos on your Google Drive account or on your current device.

:::tip Tip
To see if a module has this option, simply check the settings via this file: `packages/{PACKAGE NAME}/config/config.json`.

**In that file, set the `enabled` key to `true`** to enable the synchronizer for this specific module.
:::

| Method              | Description              |
| --------------------|---------------------------|
| `direct`            | Synchronize content on your current device. |
| `google-drive`      | Synchronize content on Google Drive. |

### Direct

```json
"synchronization": {
  "enabled": true,
  "method": "direct",
  "email": ""
}
```
> *`packages/{PACKAGE NAME}/config/config.json`*

### Google Drive

1. [Create or select a project](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) on the GCP (Google Cloud Platform).
2. Enable the [Google Drive API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com).
3. [Create a service account key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/serviceaccountkey).
4. Download the JSON file and copy its content to the: `server/src/config/synchronizer/google-drive.json` Leon's file.

```json
"synchronization": {
  "enabled": true,
  "method": "google-drive",
  "email": "{YOUR GOOGLE EMAIL ADDRESS}"
}
```
> *`packages/{PACKAGE NAME}/config/config.json`*

An email is sent to this email address once Leon has synchronized your content on your Google Drive.
